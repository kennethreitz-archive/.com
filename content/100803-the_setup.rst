The Setup

I'm Kenneth Reitz, one of the two co-founders of Züm Hosting. I'm a
passionate Python developer for `NetApp <http://netapp.com>`_. I
typically spend my nights developing a number of open source
projects, and my weekends architecting the web. What hardware are
you using? ---------------------------- My sole machine is a 2010
MacBook Pro running a Core i7 processor at 2.66 GHz w/ 8GB of DDR3
RAM. It's 15" non-reflective screen runs at a beautiful 1680 x
1050. It features both a 250GB SSD and 500 GB HDD, for a total of
750GB of local storage, thanks to the
`OptiBay <http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/>`_. I often have it
hooked up to one of many 23" LCD monitors. For general audio, I
sport a pair of Bowers & Wilkins P5 Headphones. If I'm in a
high-fidelity mood, I listen through a pair of open-backed SR-60s
from Grado Labs. For telephony, I have an HTC Supersonic (EVO)
running running the Nighty Android 2.2 (Froyo) CyanogenMod v6. This
also functions as a perfectly portable hotspot. I read
documentation and play arcade games on a 64GB Apple iPad (wifi). I
play a PSP Go solely for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I have
a large number of very powerful
`Linode <http://www.linode.com/?r=7bd5ecafdec13147c6019ca1c90884dbf994d67f>`_
servers at my disposal for various projects and builds. My system
is backed up regularly to a cheap 1TB Western Digital drive. My
media archives are backed up to a 1.5TB Seagate drive. My media
exists on a NAS attached to my Netgear WNR3500L router. My code is
backed up to various Git repositories local and across the net. All
web projects and databases of relevance are backed up to Amazon S3
on a nightly basis, along with all my tweets, Flickr photos, and
Gmail messages. And what software? ------------------ I develop and
live on the latest build of Snow Leopard. My main Python
environment is the latest 2.7 release, along with well managed
virtualenvs for all other releases
`via Buildout <http://blog.mfabrik.com/2010/07/16/easily-install-all-python-versions-under-linux-and-osx-using-collective-buildout-python/>`_.
I also employ a very large number of virtual machines, via VMWare
Fusion 3. I have a particularly efficient XP VM that is always up,
providing me with OneNote 2010. I'd do anything for Mactopia to
port OneNote to OS X. Anything. My development environment consists
of TextMate + PeepOpen, [most recently] PyCharm, SequelPro,
Titanium Mobile, Transmit, and GitX. I love using
`HTTPScoop <http://www.tuffcode.com/>`_ for request sniffing. My
favorite command-line utilities are: Terminal.app w/ Zsh + Git,
JoelTheLion's `autojump <http://github.com/joelthelion/autojump>`_,
Defunkt's `Hub <http://github.com/defunkt/hub>`_ and
`Gist <http://github.com/defunkt/gist>`_, Mcxl's
`homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_, nicksieger's
`jsonpretty <http://github.com/nicksieger/jsonpretty>`_, and
Rtomayko's `bcat <http://github.com/rtomayko/bcat>`_. On servers, I
typically run the latest Ubuntu Server release, or CentOS (but only
if I have to). I carry out heavy-duty writing with
`Ulysses Core <http://www.the-soulmen.com/ulyssescore/>`_.
`Soulver <http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/>`_ is the best
number-crunching application around. I don't know how I lived
without it. My audio production work is carried out in Adobe
Audition CS3 and FL Studio 9. I use Adobe CS5 Master Collection for
light design work and photo retouching. Photoshop Lightroom for
kosher photography dark room work. I've been meaning to get into
Fireworks for wireframing, but haven't had the time as of late. As
for architecture work, I utilize OmniGraffle for diagraming,
Mockingbird / Balsamiq for mockups, and MindNode Pro for
mind-mapping. For note taking, as mentioned, I use OneNote 2010.
Nothing compares, except my Soft Large Squared Moleskine Notebook.
My tasks are managed with
`Things.app <http://culturedcode.com/things/>`_. I can't wait till
they roll out proper syncing. If they don't do it fast enough, I'll
be switching to Macman's
`Taskforce <http://www.taskforceapp.com/>`_. I use Kindle for
purchased books, and iBooks for PDF reading on the iPad. I consume
Google Reader via `Reeder <http://reederapp.com/ipad/>`_, the most
beautiful application I have ever used. For Remote Desktop I use
`CoRD.app <http://cord.sourceforge.net/>`_. Backups are performed
by `arRsync.app <http://arrsync.sourceforge.net/>`_, a beautiful
interface for rsync. My desktop's windows are managed well with
`Cinch.app <http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/>`_. My music
library is provided by Spotify at offline, 320KBPS Ogg Vorbis
goodness. In the rare occasion that Spotify is missing an artist, I
use 320KBPS MP3s and FLAC recordings for the ultra-special tracks
(e.g. Liquid Tension Experiment). I buy my MP3s from the
(wonderful) Amazon MP3 Store. I keep my video library nice and
organized in iTunes, regardless of format, with
`iFlicks <http://www.iflicksapp.com/>`_. I stream 1080 videos,
NetFlix, and BlueRay Disks with a Play Station 3 Slim. I play
emulated retro video games Wii. Best $200 I've ever spent. For
communication, I use iChat + Chax, Linkinus, Echofon, and Skype.
What would be your dream setup? ------------------------------- No
power chord.
