|Picture 3.png| Being the programmers that we are, design isn't
always listed as one of our stronger abilities. Every programmer
should have a sense of design, however. Otherwise, every
application you would ever use would be far less useful and be much
less appealing. *Aesthetics are everything*. ColorSchemeDesigner
allows any user to create breathtaking Color Schemes for any
purpose in it's quick and easy-to-use interface. It allows you to
use the color wheel to make precisely correct schemes. Options
include: monochrome, complimentary, traids, tetrads, analogical,
and accented analogical schemes. All are fully customizable and
mathematically correct.The site even allows you take your color
scheme and test it out on a test page for web design. You can do
anything from sharing the exact scheme to your friends, to
downloading it as a Photoshop of Gimp Color Scheme, XML, or
plaintext file.
**It even will allow you to download your ColorScheme as HTML / CSS !**
What a time saver! Other services (like Adobe's
`Kuler <http://kuler.adobe.com/>`_), aren't nearly this functional,
and do not offer nearly as many features to its users. The best
thing of all is it's *free*. Give
`ColorSchemeDesigner <http://colorschemedesigner.com>`_ a try!
