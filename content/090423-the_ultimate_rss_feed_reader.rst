What would the ultimate RSS Reader have? Hmmm.... **Features:** -
Easy-to-manage import/export - Available anywhere and in a variety
of formats - Easy access to both urls and inline-viewing abilities
- Customizable fonts - Takes up less than 200 MB of RAM (this rules
out all Adobe Air Applications) - Auto feed sniffing from urls -
The ability to play podcasts and other media that is thrown at it
(unlike the PSP) - Syncing for offline viewing - Expendable

*Closest contender*: **Google Reader**! It offers all of this
functionality and more. It makes my world a better place to live.
