The Truth of Facebook's FriendFeed Acquisition

As I'm sure most of you know, `Facebook <http://facebook.com>`_
decided today that it was going to buy
`FriendFeed <http://friendfeed.com/kennethreitz>`_.

My opinion might be a little biased... I just discovered FF
`recently <http://kennethreitz.com/blog/friendfeed-is-awesome/>`_,
and I must say that I've been thoroughly impressed with the service
so far. I've been spending an increasing amount of time on it every
day, and It's most certainly a breath of fresh air from the clogged
mob-congestion of Twitter.

So apparently someone at Facebook realized this and decided to join
forces.

So what is Facebook after? Absorbing the competition? I don't think
so. Did you know FriendFeed is operated by only 11 people? and it
rocks! That's definitely 11 people who are extremely talented and
know exactly what they are doing. Something Facebook needs. They
have been trying to put something together that works as well as FF
for while now. The two merging might not be that bad, as long as FF
marches on. My last favorite social site,
`Pownce <http://pownce.com>`_, was shut down when
`Six Apart <http://sixapart.com>`_ purchased them for the creation
of `Motion <http://www.movabletype.com/motion/>`_ – an utter
failure.

**UPDATE**:

Luckily, the two companies announced today that FriendFeed will
continue to remain a separate, fully functional entity from
Facebook. Facebook will be integrating features of FriendFeed. Good
news! Lets see if it happens.
