Out of all the startup applications that I have ever used,
`Instapaper <http://instapaper.com>`_ (from the creators of
micro-blogging site `Tumblr <http://tumblr.com>`_) is by far the
most innovative and useful. I use it on a daily basis. It not only
saves me hours upon hours of time, but it allows me to focus more
on the task at hand and boosts my productivity levels through the
roof.

Whenever I'm surfing the web, I have a bad habit of clicking open
new tabs almost constantly. It's not uncommon for me to easily have
over 60 tabs open, and in the process of sorting through all these
wonderful links, the task at hand drowns in a sea of information.

Well, I don't have this problem anymore, thanks to Instapaper. When
I find something interesting online now, and it's not related to
the task at hand, I hit the nifty "read later" bookmarklet. This
ads it to my list of unread marertial on Instapaper.com. I can go
there at any time and read any of the pages that I didnt' have time
to read before!

Seriously guys, this is amazing.

What's better yet, is that they have an iPhone app. I can read my
synched list of hundreds of unread pages at any time in
Kindle-quality formated pages. Even without an internet
connection.

**Surely life doesn't get better than this.**
