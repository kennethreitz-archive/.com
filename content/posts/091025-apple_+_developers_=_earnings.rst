**Apple, Inc** reported their
`highest earnings ever <http://www.businessweek.com/technology/ByteOfTheApple/blog/archives/2009/10/apple_stock_hit.html>`_
today.
But, Why? Because they have proven that thoughtful design and
attention to every minute detail will always win in the end.

Because they have shown that designing with both developers and
users equally in mind is essential.

Because they noticed that being remarkable isn't about being the
go-to guy all the time.

Because they realized that it's okay to do not have the biggest
market share.

Because they realized there is a balance. And they found it.

Because they make the best laptops around.

Because they lead a tribe of people.

So, Congratulations Apple.

You deserve it.

Really.
