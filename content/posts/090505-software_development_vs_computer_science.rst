Software Development vs. Computer Science

Most developer job applications that I see have a "BS in Computer
Science or equivalent experience" requirement.

During my studies in Computer Science at
`George Mason University <http://kennnethreitsz.com/was-college-worth-it/>`_,
though short, I learned a number of things. One of them was what a
waste it was to learn such higher math in my field. I want to
develop software, not develop the most cunning-edge
earth-shattering algorithms. I don't want to reinvent ssh or find a
better way to implement pgp keys. Of course, those things are
necessary in certain fields, but not in mine.

I was taught that Programming is to Computer Science as a Telescope
is to Astronomy. Its a tool to get to a means. If this is true,
than why wasn't I thought how to make software?

Many Software Developers also have degrees in Electrical
Engineering. Why is this? A CS degree doesn't seem to quite fit
either. Perhaps we should make a separate degree for Software
Development?

Computer Science should be separated from Software Development.
They should be two different Degrees.

When I realized this, I started spending my time focusing on design
rather than math. I learned a great deal of things from color
theory to relational spacing and I found myself a new home: web
design. It's a beautiful field. I started to spend my own time
learning software development, rather than spending hours studying
Calc 2.
