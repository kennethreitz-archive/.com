A New Spin to Software Platform Design

\*I wrote this article two years ago, before I found OS X. I wish I
would have known then.\* As I've said before, I find many reasons
to believe that modern commercialized software platforms are
severely lacking in many, many areas. This should not come as a
surprise to anyone. Perhaps basic utility-inclusion is not the only
solution though. Perhaps the basic priority structure and ethics
that development and marketing teams utilize should be forced into
question.

Essentially, most major computer software corporations, are, all in
all, trying to make money. No matter how hard you try to find a way
around this, or justify why these companies try to do the things
that they do, the only answer is money. These companies are simply
trying to make a quick buck. This concept has worked incredibly
well for years, but we seem to have a bit of a problem with
foresight. After a while, people get rather bored with the same old
concepts being presented to them in new and exciting ways. This is
why Microsoft needs to release a new operating system every once in
a while. Microsoft's current problem is that the masses are
beginning to realize their other options.

**So here's my proposal for the long-term design and marketing strategy 2.0:**

An operating system should first be a place of power, consistency,
stability, scalability, and flexibility. Included would be a robust
and fully scriptable toolset which can be manipulated and presented
both graphically and statistically.

Second, the user interface should be very well thought out and
planned, with ample room for improvement down the road. Its purpose
should first be a place of usability, workflow, and creativity.
Task-related workflow and presentation customization, accessible to
all types of users, is crucial to the success of the UI. Second,
the User Interface should be a mode of personal expression and
aesthetic preference. This should never take precedence over the
overall stability, usability, or general usefulness of a desktop
system, for any given reason.

Lastly, the user application platform system needs to be designed.
A centralized repository of applications is an incredibly efficient
method for application distribution. This repository would be a
dynamic, centralized database of application software and packages
that are intended for different groups of people. Most major Linux
distributions use this heavily, as well as Apple for it's iPod and
iPhone applications, and it has been proven to work well.

Any of these rules should have the ability to be broken easily by
advanced power users for technical reasons/needs. This should be in
no way advertised or demonstrated.

Anyone up for the challenge?
