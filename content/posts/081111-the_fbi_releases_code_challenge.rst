The FBI Releases Code Challenge to Hackers

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, that's right, the FBI, has
just released a
`Code Challenge <%20http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/36704>`_
for hackers around the world! Here are the details:

    A relatively basic form of substitution cipher is the Caesar
    Cipher, named for its Roman origins. The Caesar Cipher involves
    writing two alphabets, one above the other. The lower alphabet is
    shifted by one or more characters to the right or left and is used
    as the cipher text to represent the plain text letter in the
    alphabet above it.


Plain Text

    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z


Cipher Text

    B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A


In this example, the plain text K is enciphered with the cipher
text L. The phrase 'Lucky Dog' would be enciphered as follows:

Plain Text: L U C K Y D O G

Cipher Text: M V D L Z E P H

Ciphers can be made more secure by using a keyword to scramble one
of the alphabets. Keywords can be placed in the plain text, the
cipher text, or both, and any word can be used as a key if repeated
letters are dropped. Here the word SECRETLY (minus the second E) is
used as the plain text keyword.

Plain Text

S E C R T L Y A B D F G H I J K M N O P Q U V W X Z

Cipher Text

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

The FBI of course doesn't always invite folks to break code on its
site. In fact last spring a consultant managed to access the
bureau's National Crime Information Center database.

Is this a ploy to get the hacker community back to its roots? Most
certainly we seem to loose touch to what this is all about. Or
perhaps just an elaborate way to recruit future employees due to
the inability to advertise for positions?

What do you think?
