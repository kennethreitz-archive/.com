I've said it before and I'll say it again:
`TextMate <http://kennethreitz.com/blog/if-textmate-42/>`_ is one
fantastic text editor.

Now, I won't bore you with my passion for it, but if you've been
reading my blog for long, you know how I feel.I do the majority of
my development in TextMate, so theme choice is pretty important
(others beg to differ but I disagree – aesthetics are everything).
I tried a number of themes and found some really great ones. I'm
always partial to darker schemes, so I settled on using Vibrant
Ink. Fantastic theme. After a while, I needed a break from the dark
background, and decided to find a more minimalist white-based theme
online. Much to my avail, I discovered that there are no good
ligher-colored themes out there for TextMate. Some come close, but
nothing hits the nail on the head. So I made one.

I call it **Smoothy**
(`screenshot <http://media.kennethreitz.com/themes/Smoothy.tmTheme.gif>`_,

`TmTheme Download it here (65KB) <http://media.kennethreitz.com/themes/Smoothy.tmTheme>`_
So, after a great number of hours, and realizing that making things
coordinate on black is far easier than white, I settled on a theme
that was colorful, functional, useful, triatic, and
most-importantly, not a piece of crap. Enjoy!
