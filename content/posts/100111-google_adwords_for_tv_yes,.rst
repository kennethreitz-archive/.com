Today, Google unveiled their latest technology:
`AdWords for TV <http://www.google.com/adwords/tvads/index-b.html>`_
and
`AdSense for TV <https://www.google.com/adsense/www/en_US/tv/>`_.
This totally blows my mind. They are about to totally revolutionize
the television industry. You can manage TV ads just like you manage
AdWords ads for the web. You enter the amount you're willing to pay
per impression, and your daily budget, and Google does the rest.
Google is the future of all advertizing. NBC, be afraid. From
Google: The results were extraordinary. Web traffic to ooVoo.com
increased by 500% and ooVoo-related search queries rose by more
than 200% over pre-campaign levels."
*- Lisa Abourezk, VP of marketing, ooVoo*
