Back to What I Really Love

A couple of months ago, I took a position at a company that tailors
Microsoft SharePoint solutions. The business model was very strong
(and successful), the work was challenging, and there was lots of
opportunity. At the end of the day though, I just couldn't get past
one thing: Microsoft and.NET. This is not stuff that I wanted to
spend the rest of my life. The company offered very generous
compensation for Microsoft Certification – but what good does that
do me? I could do it, but it would only be for the money. I love
working with software of all kinds, but the development I was doing
did not sharpen my skills in any way. So, I decided that the longer
I stayed, the more I would simply be delaying my leaving. So
another opportunity came up, and I decided to take it. I am now a
developer working with PHP, Symfony, Java, Groovy, Grails, Apache,
and more. The list grows every day. Now life is good. It's never
been better in fact.
