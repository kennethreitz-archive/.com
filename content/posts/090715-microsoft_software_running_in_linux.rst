A few months ago, I wrote a small article for
`ProgramerFish <http://programmerfish.com/>`_ that was
`featured on SlashDot's Front Page <http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/17/2235215>`_.
It was amazing. Within hours, my post had thousands of views and
hundreds of comments. People both loved and hated the idea.

But what made
`my post <http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/17/2235215>`_
so popular? The fact that I showed people how to run a very popular
piece of proprietary software in Linux. And this made a very large
number of people very angry. Why though? Half the users of linux
are openly against proprietary software.

But Certainly software is just a means to an end, not and end
itself.

They failed to see the point. All they cared about was letting
everyone else know how much they hated my idea.

I inadvertently started a mini-controversy. And it got attention.

Sometimes the best way to be heard is to say something people don't
like to hear.
