Here's a small list of 2009 *New Year's Resolutions* for your
startup. ### 1. Simplify Anyone can make something complex. It
takes thoughtful planning, consideration, and discipline to make
something simple. Simple = elegant. The same applies to your
business. ### 2. Get some Humility Don't assume you know what your
audience wants.

### 3. Release a Real Product 10,000 great ideas are worthless if
you never act upon them. Pick one. Pick three and mix. Release. ###
4. The Opposite is Also True Your product can be enormously
successful for a single feature. Someone else's product will be
even more successful for excluding that same feature. ### 5. Loose
the Bulk Startups

The more you spend, the less you earn. Keep things small. Keep
things simple. You'll thrive.
