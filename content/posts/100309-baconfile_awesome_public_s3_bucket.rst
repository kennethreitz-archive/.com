`|baconfile-sticker.png| <http://baconfile.com>`_ ## Amazon S3 is a
fantastic data storage platform — I use it for everything. It's
perfect for sharing data with friends. The only disadvantage is the
interface: there is none. You can manage your buckets files with
REST requests, along with a number of desktop clients. That's fine,
but what about your visitors? The only way to show them what you
have to offer is to build a frontend system that ties into the API.
### The Solution **Baconfile**: Simple S3 Frontend. You'll never be
happier. Check out me out at
