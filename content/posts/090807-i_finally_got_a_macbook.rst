Yesterday I stopped by the Apple store in Fair Oaks Shopping Center
in Fairfax, VA and finally purchased a MacBook. I've been wanting
one for quite a while – ever since I fell deeply in love with OS X
after adopting an old 12" G4 PowerBook I've been using for the past
5 months.

I decided to get the 2.5 GHz 13" MacBook Pro. This will be my
full-time machine for the next 4+ years hopefully. With specs this
good and a case this sturdy, I see no reason why it shouldn't last
me for years to come.

I am thoroughly pleased with the purchase so far. If you've been
planning on getting a MacBook, *now is the time to get one*. The
base line 13" Aluminum Pro model is only $1100 right now – cheaper
than most of the refurbished polycarbonates with lower specs.
Anyway, I'll post lists of my software choices (including TextMate
Plugins and Bundles) soon for those interested. Stay tuned!
