I am extremely happy to announce that I am joining the `Heroku <http://heroku.com>`_ team!

If you aren't familiar, Heroku is a Polyglot Platform as a Service for hosting
web applications. The product is executed so well that they are responsible for
an entire micro-industry of PaaS platforms for different languages
(Python included). Company after company strives to
become the "Heroku for *x*".

Until recently, there were only a few `good options <http://ep.io>`_ for modern
Python deployment. However, a few months ago, Heroku added
`official Python support <http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/9/28/python_and_django/>`_
to the Cedar stack — it is *beautiful*.

The Job
~~~~~~~

I will be responsible for the technical design of Heroku's Python offering, as well as Heroku’s voice in the Python community.

Other responsibilities will include:

- Contributing to open source projects.
- Driving best practices adoption.
- Be passionate about the general success of Python.

Best. Job. Ever.


Arc90 + Readability?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arc90 + Readability and myself have parted ways on excellent terms.
Leaving the team was a very difficult decision to make. Readability is a
hard-working team of incredible individuals, working passionately on one
of my favorite online tools.

Readability is very much in a "move as fast as possible" stage of growth.
Unfortunately, my passions for workflow automation, best-practices,
and autonomy proved to mix harshly with the style of Readability's operation.

We're very proud of what we `built over the past six months <http://blog.readability.com/2011/11/reading-needs-a-platform-introducing-the-new-readability/>`_, and I look forward to seeing the platform grow.


Heroku's Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've always found myself attracted to beautiful and elegant architectures and APIs.
Heroku is a natural perfect fit. They're inspiring as both a Product, a Platform, and a Company. Here are a few selections of team marketing:

On craft:

    "Heroku is a do-ocracy. Makers of every stripe are welcomed here. Amazing ideas and execution are rewarded with independence and trust."

On productivity:

    "From customer facing roles to our developers, we believe in building, not meeting."

Lastly, my personal favorite:

    "We spend as long as it takes to make things right."


Needless to say, I'm tremendously excited about becoming an official Herokai™.
