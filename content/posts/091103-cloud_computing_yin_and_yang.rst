Cloud computing enables us. Amazon's EC2 allows anyone in the world
to have instant access to incredibly powerful high-end servers that
would usually cost tens of thousands of dollars for pennies on the
dollar. ##Life is good. Of course, people use this technology for
both good and bad. In fact, a few days ago, someone wrote a
tutorial
for`Cracking PGP with an Amazon EC2 instance & EDPR <http://news.electricalchemy.net/2009/10/cracking-passwords-in-cloud.html>`_.
Again, life is good. **Remember:** if you create an successful open
door web service, all people, good and bad, will come. |image|
