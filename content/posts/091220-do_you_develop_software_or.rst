Do You Develop Software or Experiences?

I read an
`interesting article <http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/12/21st_century_phone.html>`_
today on Apple's marketing strategy. A certain section stood out to
me, regarding their hardware manufacturing: > Apple is an
experience company. They're a high-end marque; if they > were in
the automobile business, they'd be BMW, Mercedes, and > Porsche
rolled into one. They own about 12% of the PC market in the >
USA... but 91% of the high end of the PC market (laptops over $999,
> desktops over $699).

## The Point: `Seth Godin <http://sethgodin.typepad.com/>`_ and
`37Signals <http://37signals.com/>`_ both recommend marketing
yourself to the early adopters and geeks. Apple, however, does the
opposite. They market themselves to the middle market — the
incredibly non-technical. The geeks come on their own, with no
marketing needed. They love it. And this makes Apple \*enormously\*
successful. \*\*Develop your software/experience for the
masses\*\*. Make the geeks love it, but make them find it on their
own. Just a thought.
