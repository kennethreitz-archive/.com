Facebook vs Twitter: A Critical Synopsis

For the sake of us all, lets take a look at two major social
networks on the web today: `Facebook <http://facebook.com>`_ and
`Twitter <http://twitter.com/kennethreitz>`_.

Twitter is an information-streaming application that is used by
people in all walks of life. It functions, sometimes in roundabout
ways, as an instant messenger, email client, alert system, and
social networking connectivity tool. It also offers fantastic,
powerful searching and heavily encourages all-in-all openness.

Facebook, when I was introduced to it, was an application that
allowed users to create a simple page with information about
themselves, and connected them with people they knew in real life.
Users could send messages to one another, both privately and
publicly, post links, and upload an unlimited number of photos. Or
at least it was.

Recently, Facebook revamped their interface and introduced a
reinforced concept of status updates being a "life-stream" rather
than a "summary of my week". Much emphasis is placed on what is
going on *right now*, not what happened yesterday. This is great in
my opinion – however, it totally changes what Facebook is for me.
Prior to the change, when adding a friend, much emphasis was placed
on adding relationship details for all of your friends. If you
didn't know someone, Facebook wouldn't even allow you to keep them
as a friend. Now, Facebook auto-suggest people that it thinks you
might know, and encourages the meeting of people through Facebook
itself. Nothing wrong with that of course... I'm just showing how
it has been changed.

There's a fundamental difference here:
**Twitter changes with its users.**

It changes according to the trends of it's users. Twitter does
absolutely nothing to influence they way its users use its
services. In fact, it evolves *with* them. For example, Twitter
allowed users to view when people @replied to their tweets by going
to the @replies section of the user interface. In this section, you
could see a list of all the latest tweets that started with
'@yourtwittername' and see what people had to say to you. After a
while, users started adding @replies everywhere in tweets, not just
the beginning. So, twitter changed the algorithm, and now you can
see when '@yourtwittername' is mentioned anywhere in a tweet.
Genius.

**Facebook tries to change its users.**

When was the last time you heard a bunch of Twitter users complain
about a newly implimented feature? and when was the last time you
heard a Facebook user complain of a new feature or interface
change?
Yes, they complain constantly.

So, what is Facebook's purpose? To deliver useful content and
introduce you to new people (while delivering ads), or providing a
nice platform for friends to connect with eachother? If you ask me,
Facebook's intended purpose is becoming less and less clear the
longer that I use it.

Go Twitter.
