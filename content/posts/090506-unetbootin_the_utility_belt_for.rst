If you're in the mood to try a new operating system or two, I
highly reccommend you try this little utility: uNetBootin. It is an
image downloader that lets you easily select which Linux distro
you'd like to install and it instantly starts fetching it from the
cloud for you. Once the download is complete, it will allow you to
put that bootable image on a jump-drive for super easy and quick
installs.

attempt to get it to work in OS X yet. I'm sure it's not too hard
though :)
