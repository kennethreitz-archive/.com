KennethReitz.com now has a new, rich theme, ready to take on a new
life. And now iPhone friendly! My gloal? To become more well known
that both `Joel Spolsky <http://joelonsoftware.com>`_ and
`Chris Parillo <http://chris.parillo.com>`_. Nothing wrong with
them, of course. I'm just as qualified though. And I think I might
bring more to the table. Think I can do it?

I built the site with PHP on top of Wordpress with a hint of
Coreylib and jQuery. A nice mix, if you ask me. I ditched
`DISQUS <http://disqus.com/>`_ in favor of IntenseDebate (as you
can see below). DISQUS has a terrible media server that fails
constantly. I can't stand that.
`IntenseDebate <http://intensedebate.com>`_ comes pre-themed too,
and, I must say, it looks *nice*.

The design was inspired by `haveamint.com <http://haveamint.com>`_.
They did a phenomenal job and I wanted to take what they had and
build from it. Expect this to be update much more frequently.
Hopefully daily.
