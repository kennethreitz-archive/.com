I've owned about 5 WIndows Mobile devices, 3 Palm Devices, and 1
iPhone.

What we all need:


-  Simplicity
-  Power
-  Reliability
-  Speed
-  Integration

**Palm OS** (Pre-Pre haha):


-  Simple. Very Simple.
-  Does what it needs to do and doesn't falter.
-  Not much in terms of applications.
-  Most certainly not designed for a mobile professional.
-  It's a glorified rolodex.

**Windows Mobile** (5, 6, 6.1):


-  Attempts to satisfy someone who needs to read spreadsheets on
   the go.
-  Very slow and unstable. Not good for phone use. At all.
-  Integration is sub-par.
-  Lots of work-arounds for lots of things, nothing is simple.
-  Fonts are ugly.
-  Interface is clunky.

**iPhone OS**:


-  Smooth, and very nice looking.
-  Font rendering is exceptional.
-  Web browsing is a dream.
-  Did I mention how good it looks?
-  Fantastic applications, integration, and standards.
-  Apps need approval (good and bad).
-  Very fast. Very slick. Problem free.

**Verdict**:

iPhone OS simply cannot be beat. It's perfect. I haven't used
Android, but it's more of a platform than an intended
out-of-the-box Mobile OS. You aren't intended to use the built-in
Window Manager if you don't want to. Windows Mobile: pay
attention.
