For the past year I've been employed at
`Clutch, Inc <http://clutch-inc.com>`_ in Winchester, Virginia, as
a Systems Engineer and Web Developer. I've spent most of my time
there developing content-based websites and web applications in
PHP, advanced JavaScript, Grails, and the like. I even had the
opportunity to develop the occassional Python application for
server-side data manipulation/migration. But alas, all good things
must come to an end. To that end, I have accepted a new position as
a Senior Python Developer at
`Network Appliance <http://www.netapp.com>`_ (RTP Campus), starting
next week. One of the best parts of this opportunity will be my
ability to work remotely from my hometown of Winchester, Virginia.
I'll be setting up office in
`Bright Cowork <http://brightcowork.com>`_ on the walking mall.
While moving from service-oriented web development to internal
tool/application development will be a change of pace, it's a very
welcome one, and I look forward to every moment of it. I plan to
leave my web development efforts to my various open source projects
and client work, but on an as-need basis. My next step is to to
focus my personal efforts on a new market entirely: iPhone app
development & the iTunes store.
