Google just launched a
`Public DNS Service <http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/>`_,
much like OpenDNS. ###Let me Try! To give it a try, change your
computer (our router)'s DNS servers.
``DNS Servers: 4.3.2.1, 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4`` I expect this to have
significantly greater adoption rates than OpenDNS, since the IP
Address of the servers are much easier to remember.
