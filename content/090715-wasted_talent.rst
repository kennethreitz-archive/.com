Wasted Talent

I'd say that 95% percent of the students that I met at George Mason
University my Freshman year had *no idea* why they were even there.
This is so sad.

For me, going to college was more about getting out of the house
than anything else. And it worked. I did get out of the house. And
I learned a lot. I found my passion.

Other students worked their butts off trying to take as many
credits as possible, and when asked what they want to do for a
living they don't have the slightest idea. Why would you go to
college if you don't even know what you want to major in? I would
think that spending all that money would be in order to achieve a
goal, but apparently not.

*They are just along for the ride.*
