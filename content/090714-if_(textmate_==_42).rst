**{** I've had some pretty extensive experience using every major
OS for various forms of development and end-user work. And just
like every other programmer in the world, I certainly have my
opinions, likes, and dislikes of every platform (some are a lot
closer to perfection than others of course). Text editors are the
same way. Everyone loves one or two, and hates all the others.
There are others of course: I actually know a guy who edits his
live "enterprise-level php applications" with Pico. And he says he
has been for 10 years (Note that Pico has only been out for 9
years). What a joke. > Pico is not a programmer's tool.

But anyway: For literally decades, there has been a great war
between unix developers.
`VI(m) vs. Emacs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war>`_. I am
most certainly a proponent of VI, and probably always will be. It's
a fantastic editor, and it suits my needs pefectly. And for those
of us who need something a little more streamlines there's always
`CREAM <http://cream.sourceforge.net/>`_, which is a fantastic
implementation of a heavily customized GVIM that can handle
literally anything you throw at it with little or no fuss. Now all
software, in any context, is a tool. Nothing more. VI and EMACS and
all others exist for one reason: to make a programmer's life
easier. That's why they were invented, and that's why they are
maintained. Now, I still use VIM all the time in my day-to-day
life. Its wonderful to SSH into just about any \*nix server on the
planet, and have VIM sitting there, waiting for me to tell it what
to do. It helps me to feel at home. I used to use it full-time for
all of my coding on my workstations as well. I was passionate about
it. I'd tote VIM all the time. VIM is great. It seemed so. It used
to. |image|Used to. And then there was TextMate. TextMate.
TextMate. Have a mac?
`Try it <http://download-b.macromates.com/TextMate_1.5.8.dmg>`_.
Now.
`Download it <http://download-b.macromates.com/TextMate_1.5.8.dmg>`_.
`Buy it <http://license.macromates.com/>`_. Pirate it, I don't
care. **Your life will never be the same.** TextMate is seriously
the best piece of software I have come across in a very very long
time. I can code incredibly fast with it. It helps me to become a
better programmer. We all agree that you should NEVER Copy and
Paste code: but using code snippets is different. It's like... An
experience I cannot describe. I'll be purchasing a new laptop soon,
and to be honest with you, the fact that I'll have TextMate on a
mac makes me sure without a doubt to get an Apple computer. That
and the fact that Mac OS X is a FANTASTIC operating system) >
TextMate is a text editor like no other.

There's nothing better. And there never will. I know that's quite
an extreme statement, but it's true. I'll do a full review
eventually. I'm just so blown away. Sorry for my thoughts being all
over the place in this post. I can't think strait.
