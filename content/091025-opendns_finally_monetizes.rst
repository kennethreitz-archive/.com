I've been a long-time fan and user of
**`OpenDNS <http://www.opendns.com>`_**, the free and
often-superior DNS Server. I've always noticed drastic improvements
in my site loading speeds when using the service (due to
drastically improved domain name lookups). There's really no
downside to using the system. It's significantly faster than most
ISP's own DNS servers, and it's updated far more frequently.
##Announcing OpenDNS Monetization OpenDNS now offers a new service
called **OpenDNS Deluxe**, which is tailed for the average
household as well as smaller companies. ###Premium Support It
allows users to have an ad-free experience and have priority over
free members. The price for this service is only $9.95 a year. Not
too bad! ###For Power Users They are also offering a very robust
**OpenDNS Enterprise** edition for medium to fortune 500 companies.
It has many advanced features such as: delegated administration,
advanced reporting, and malware site protection. ###Pricing That
price isn't listed :)
