Was College Worth It?

George Mason University (at which I'm currently a non-studying
student) is a fantastic environment for a student in their 20's.
Never before have I felt so *enabled*. The campus allowed me to
have a completely restriction-free place to live with peers of my
own age, and millions of resources an average American could only
dream of having free access to:


-  Olympic-sized swimming pool minutes away
-  Every restaurant under the sun within walking distance
-  Free Kitchens and items promoting every brand under the sun
-  You don't go to stores – they come to you
-  Free food. Alot of it.
-  Functions and for everything under the sun.
-  Seminars from the Brightest Minds in Computer Science
-  Professors willing to go the extra mile for you
-  Dozens of cultures fused into one working student-body
-  An incredibly Culturally-Diverse Campus (taco bell and Islamic
   meditation lounge in the same building)

These are the things that I miss. I crave the "college experience"
so much, but that makes me realize something: I didn't go to
college for an education – I went there to get away. And I did so.

I failed. I had my heart broken (ish). I got into trouble. I
reached out to the needy and regretted it. I worked for notable
causes. I got a job. I strayed from truth. I got severely addicted
to Caffeine. I was forgiven. I slept in. I researched. I learned to
discern from someone who's worth my time and someone who's not. I
learned to prioritize. Lateralus. I wasted people's time. I was
used. I experimented. I fell asleep every morning during an
all-you-can-eat breakfast fit for a king. I relieved my childhood.
I saw others lives fall apart. I learned to drive. I went way too
fast. I forgot to prioritize. I found the most breathtaking music
on earth. I made mistakes. I connected. I had a fantastic night. I
played live shows. I was shot down. I failed miserably at Ju Jit
Su. I was accused of Harrassment–I was totally innocent. I had the
worst sleeping schedule on earth. I didn't try Salvia. I saw the
best movies. I met the most amazing people. I shook Bill Clinton's
hand. I got first-hand internet experience I couldn't have dreamed
of having before. I found my true passions. I learned without being
taught. I saw some funny videos. I made some awesome friends. I
lost some too. I joined a riot. I learned that I do way too many
things at once. I lost a job. I learned to sell myself. I learned
how to present myself. And, most importantly,
*I learned what was truly important in life*.

So, here I stand, $10,000 dollars in debt with a GPA of 1.14 and 8
credit hours – and I've never been happier. That was a $10K well
spent.

    And I have never been happier.
