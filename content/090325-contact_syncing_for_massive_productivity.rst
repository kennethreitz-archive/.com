Google significantly increased my quality of life recently. How?
Let me explain. While I am a firm believer that cloud computing
should *never* be viewed as a replacement for the current desktop/
model, I must say that I am now a **huge** fan of storing my data
on the internet. Not all of my data, keep in mind, but information
that needs to be accessed by multiple computers, of course – but
that goes without saying.

I have always had the problem of not being able to keep track of
all my data. I switch computers and operating systems so often, I
can't keep track of my contacts at all. And when I update one, I
have to go through and update many different databases – not the
most efficient method.

So, the ultimate solution is – obviously – to consolidate all of my
contacts into one database. I used to keep all of my contacts on my
Samsung Blackjack cellphone. This worked well, since I could easily
sync it with a computer. This caused a problem, however: I could
only sync it with one system. If I was at work or on another
system, I had no way to get to my friend's email addresses.

Last month, Google Contacts started to support Exchange Syncing,
which happens to work *flawlessly* with my Windows Mobile 6.1
install.

My life will never be the same. Thank you, Google. I am eternally
grateful.

More details soon!
