Reflections on Windows 7

While I have not had the opportunity to try the latest Windows 7
Release Candidate, I have done a bit of reading on the subject. In
my research, I have made the following observances

Vista was truly the worst operating system I have ever used in my
life. It had some wonderful features, but everything was tied
together so inefficiently It could bring the fastest computer
around to its knees. I have used Vista on a rather powerful quad
core system with over 4 GB of RAM, and it still responded poorly.
There were a few things in Vista that were wonderful ideas, but
executed horribly:


-  Integrated Search and Indexing
-  ReadyBoost for superior caching
-  Windows XP Compatibility Mode
-  Application Pre-Caching based on Observed User Activity
-  Bending over backwards for old API compatibility

Windows 7 looks promising, however. Take a look at the list of new
improvements:


-  Transparent Windows XP Virtualization Compatibility Layer
-  Responsiveness existent
-  Advanced Window Management Abilities
-  New Version of ReadyBoost
-  Integrated ClearType Tuning (about time)
-  Feature-Packed Application Bar

Windows 7 is what Vista was supposed to be from what I understand.
I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I do look forward to this new
Operating System. I sincerely hope that it truly is a great
improvement. We'll see.
