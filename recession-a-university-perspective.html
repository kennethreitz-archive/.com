		<p>Newest update on the recession:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the George Mason University Community:</p>
<p>For over a year now the global financial situation has steadily
worsened, and many aspects of life have become more difficult for
many Americans. There is little evidence that the world or national
economies are rebounding or showing signs of an imminent recovery.</p>
<p>We share the hope that was so profoundly expressed by President
Obama during his inaugural speech of a better day in the months and
years ahead, and his resolve to view this financial situation as an
opportunity for improvement. How long the economic crisis will
persist is unknown to any of us. The road ahead will not be easy,
but if we keep our focus and reaffirm our commitment to protect the
core, we will endure and be well positioned when the economy
rebounds.</p>
<p>Our institutional vital signs are stronger than ever as we have
assembled a teaching and research faculty who continuously advance
the reputation of the institution. We have achieved national
recognition for our teaching excellence, as well as several
breakthrough discoveries in various areas of research. The number
of student applications is higher than ever, and the quality of
incoming undergraduate, transfer, and graduate students is superior
to any previous year. Our retention rate and graduation rate are at
all-time highs. We award more degrees annually than any other
college or university in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and our
alumni are increasingly being tapped as highly respected regional,
national, and international leaders. National publications have
acknowledged our institutional advancement and our outstanding
value to our students. These rankings and accomplishments are a
direct reflection of the effort and commitment made by you.</p>
<p>As we are currently expending approximately $250 million per year
on new construction and improvements, we are not only changing the
face of our campuses but serving as a major contributor to the
Northern Virginia economy at a time when so many other economic
drivers are either stagnant or declining. By any measurement, we
are highly efficient and effective in how we manage the university,
and this is true of both our academic administration and our
support services. However, as state support declines and day-to-day
responsibilities increase, certainly you must question how we can
possibly do more. Yet we know we must. We must continue to find
ways to work smarter and more effectively.</p>
<p>The provost and senior vice president have held informational
sessions to explain our budget reduction strategies as we have
absorbed a 5 percent General Fund reduction in FY 2008; another 7
percent budget reduction in FY 2009 with the high probability of a
deeper cut in state support next year (FY 2010). As you probably
know, the governor recommended another 8 percent General Fund
reduction for FY 2010. Operating plans for FY 2010 are currently
being developed which will provide us with the necessary
information to make the wisest possible resource allocation
decision.</p>
<p>As the state continues to struggle financially, we must focus our
efforts on keeping higher education accessible to new and returning
students. This will be a monumental task as we brace ourselves for
what will most likely be a substantial reduction in state support
this coming year. Therefore, I have decided to establish an Adverse
Economy Assistance Fund to assist students whose family’s economic
situation has been dramatically weakened by job loss or other
catastrophic incidents as a result of the economic crisis.
Established at $150,000 and to be used by the Office of Financial
Aid in conjunction with other available assistance to help
students, this fund will hopefully make the difference between
either continuing their studies or withdrawing from George Mason
University for many students.</p>
<p>The university’s endowment performance for the past year, though
experiencing a double-digit decline, achieved a top quartile peer
ranking. A priority for Mason is to continue to build on the
success of the recently completed capital campaign that raised more
than $140 million for George Mason University. In 2008 we raised
more dollars, gifts, and pledges than ever in the history of Mason.
We are enormously grateful to the thousands of Mason supporters who
continue to invest in the future of this great institution. Your
support is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Our university culture is marked by a commitment to improvement, a
relentless search for best practices, and a quest for excellence.
We know that only through the alignment of a shared vision and a
university spirit that embraces diversity and civility can we
advance those actions that will strengthen the core values of this
great university. There is no easy answer to maintaining
institutional momentum during difficult financial times, but being
resilient and optimistic is the foundation of our plan.</p>
<p>Our strength is our people. Several university community members
have already made significant contributions by volunteering to
accept salary reductions, deferring compensation package increases,
individually absorbing costs that otherwise would be eligible for
state reimbursement, and contributing larger amounts of
unrestricted donations to the George Mason University Foundation. A
different person seems to step up every day to lead us on this
journey. That is what makes George Mason University so special.</p>
<p>We will emerge a better university after these turbulent times
because each of you believes that you can make a difference at
Mason—and you can—and you do. Although challenged by these
financial constraints, we will rally together to build an
institution that will withstand today’s economic downturn and be
prepared to meet any future challenges. It is our responsibility,
our opportunity, to take advantage of this economic downturn and do
whatever we can to lift tomorrow’s leaders onto our shoulders so
they may view a horizon that inspires hope and promise and the
opportunity to fulfill their dreams of a better tomorrow. We in
higher education hold the key to their success. Together we can do
this! We are Mason.</p>
<p>Alan G. Merten</p>
